### Disclaimer: This project will not be continued (if at all it began)

This is as a result of my recent finding about the js-cookie library, and how it uses converters to intercept cookie data when it is being stored and retrieved.

To have a look on how this project's goals will be achieved with Converters, check this [repository](https://github.com/felixfavour/cookies-converter-demo).
